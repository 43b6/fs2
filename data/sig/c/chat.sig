    Take me                               So
    Someplace that is not here            Take me
                                          Someplace that is not here
    The birds sing
    A poem in foreign words               I want to be happy with you
    An unreachable sky                    I want to be your happiness
    Even with wings

    Someplace where you cannot go alone                -from <CLOVER>
