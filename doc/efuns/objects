objects(3)            LPC 系统函数            objects(3)

名称
     objects - return an array of all loaded objects

语法
     object *objects( string func, object ob ); object  *objects(
     function f);

描述
     An array of every object loaded on the mud  is  returned  by
     objects().   Note that if the system's maximum array size is
     set too low, objects() will truncate  its  array,  in  which
     case it might not be too useful.

     If the optional `func' and `ob' parameters are  given,  then
     ob->func() is called with each loaded object as an argument.
     If  the  function  returns  nonzero,  then  that  object  is
     returned by objects(), otherwise it isn't.

     If 'f' is given, it will be called on  all  the  objects  as
     above.   For example, objects( (: clonep :) ) returns a list
     of all the clones in existence.
