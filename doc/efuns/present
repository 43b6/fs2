present(3)            LPC 系统函数            present(3)

名称
     present() - find an object by id

语法
     object present( mixed str, object ob );

描述
     If an object that identifies to the name `str'  is  present,
     then return it.

     `str' can also be an object, in which case the test is  much
     faster and easier.

     If `ob' is given, then the search is done in  the  inventory
     of  `ob', otherwise the object is searched for in the inven-
     tory of the current object, and  in  the  inventory  of  the
     environment of the current object.
