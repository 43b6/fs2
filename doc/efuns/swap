swap(3)               LPC 系统函数               swap(3)

名称
     swap - swap out a file explicitly

语法
     void swap( object );

描述
     This efun should be reserved for debugging only.  It  allows
     an  object  to be explicitly swapped out.  If enabled, it is
     strongly recommended that a simul_efun  override  (for  this
     efun) be used to prevent abuse.

     Note: objects which have been  destructed,  already  swapped
     out,  contain  a  heart beat, cloned, inherited, or interac-
     tive, cannot be swapped out.
