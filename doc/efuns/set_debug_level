描述
     This efun is only available when the driver is compiled with
     -DDEBUG_MACRO.   The  purpose  of  this efun is to allow the
     amount and type of debugging information produced to be con-
     trolled from within the mud (while the driver is running).

     For  more  information,  read  the  file  debug.h  which  is
     included with the driver source.
