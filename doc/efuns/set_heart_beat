set_heart_beat(3)     LPC 系统函数     set_heart_beat(3)

名称
     set_heart_beat() - enable or disable an object's heartbeat

语法
     int set_heart_beat( int flag );

描述
     Passing `flag' as 0 disables the object's heart beat.  Pass-
     ing  a  `flag'  of 1 will cause heart_beat() to be called in
     the object once each heart beat (a variable  number  defined
     by  your local administrator, usually 2 seconds).  Passing a
     `flag' of greater than 1 will  usually  set  the  number  of
     heart  beats  inbetween  calls to heart_beat(), however your
     local administrator may have the system configured to  treat
     any `flag' above 1 as 1.
