PLURALIZE(2)               silmul_efun               PLURALIZE(2)

名称
     pluralize - 把单数名词变成复数名词.

语法
     string pluralize(string str);

描述
     This simul_efun goes to great lengths to try and  produce  a
     valid  plural  form for whatever is passed in str.  It tries
     to take into  account  such  special  cases  as  "knife"  ->
     "knives", "ring of protection" -> "rings of protection", and
     "an ancient dagger" -> "ancient  daggers".  Of  course,  the
     best  way  to get the plural of the name of an object is for
     that object to call set_plural() from  /std/object.   Always
     use  query_plural()  to  get the plural form of the object's
     name.
